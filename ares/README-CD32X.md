# ares CD32X

ares v148 with a **RAM cart** for Sega CD + 32X ("CD32X") games: the cart that the
Kobo / OpenLara / OpenJazz / Hurrican / SuperTux / OutRun / Sonic CD boot stacks copy
the game into. Without it those discs stop at the boot splash in every emulator.

## Use (Windows)

1. Download `ares-cd32x-windows-x64.zip` from this repository's **Releases**
   (`cd32x-latest`), unzip, run `ares.exe`.
2. Put your Sega CD BIOS files in the **`bios`** folder next to `ares.exe` as `bios_CD_U.bin`
   (US), `bios_CD_J.bin` (Japan) and `bios_CD_E.bin` (Europe): ares uses them by default.
   (Or set them in **Settings → Firmware → Mega CD**.) The 32X boot ROMs are built in.
3. **Settings → Options → Mega Drive Settings**: `Mega CD 32X: RAM cart` is on by
   default. Pick the **cart type** (the paged **16MB-PCB-CD32X**, or a **Mega EverDrive PRO**:
   see below) and which **cart (1-9)** is in the slot; **Create** makes that cart as a blank
   16 MB file (it asks before replacing one that exists). *Write-protect* if wanted. The choice
   applies at the next load.
4. **Load → Sega → Mega CD 32X**, pick the game's `.cue`.

ares keeps running when its window loses focus (Settings → Drivers → Input → *When focus is
lost: Block input*): the game and its music go on, and keys typed in other windows don't reach
it. Choose *Pause emulation* there for upstream's behaviour, or *Allow input* to keep a
controller working while another window is in front.

Each cart is saved (battery-backed, like the real cart) to `Systems\RAM Cart 16 MB-<n>.ram`
next to `ares.exe`: nine separate carts, each shared by every disc you run with it, exactly
as a physical cart is. Carts marked *(none)* in Options have no file yet: the first game that
runs with one creates it, or press **Create**. (A `RAM Cart 16 MB.ram` from the
first build becomes cart 1.) Games that know only the 4 MB cart see its layout: after reset
the 16 MB board shows pages 0 and 1, which is the 4 MB cart.

## Mega EverDrive PRO (16 MB)

The EverDrive PRO's extended SSF mapper with its write bit makes it 16 MB of RAM for a 32X
program: tested on a console with the CD32X BootCamp's `edtest` ROMs (all 27 banks, the 68000 and
both SH2s, 0 bad words). ares has it in three ways:

| How | What ares does |
|---|---|
| **A `SEGA SSF` ROM with no SRAM entry in its header** (Load → Mega 32X or Mega Drive) | The ROM in the EverDrive's 16 MB, as the EverDrive menu starts it. Its save RAM is bank 31 (512 KB, the `.ram` save file). `edtest` shows the console's result: ALL TESTED BANKS OK. (A `SEGA SSF` ROM *with* an SRAM entry keeps the standard board here - on the console the EverDrive's mapper is on for it too, and bank 31 is the memory the OS saves; build such a probe without the entry to run it in ares.) |
| **The RAM cart of a CD32X disc** (cart type *Mega EverDrive PRO*) | The disc boots with the EverDrive as a launcher leaves it: write on, banks 0-7 in windows 0-7, CART_IN released. Carts 1-9 are `Systems\EverDrive PRO 16 MB-<n>.ram`. (A model, not the console: see below.) |
| **The cartridge boot** (`ares-headless --ramcart-type everdrive --ramcart-boot EDCD.32X`) | What the console does (25 Oct 2026): it boots the launcher from the EverDrive, which starts the Sega CD itself and hands over to the disc's stack; the EverDrive stays the cartridge at `0x000000`. CD32X BootCamp `docs/12`. |

| Register (write-only, /TIME) | |
|---|---|
| `0xA130F0` CTRL0 | `P X W L C . . . . . . R R R R R`: taken only with P (bit 15) set. X = 32X mode (no effect), W = write enable, L = LED, C = CART_IN (no effect on the console: the EverDrive stays the cartridge), R = the bank in window 0 |
| `0xA130F2`-`FE` CTRL1-7 | the bank (0-31, bits 0-4) in each 512 KB window of cart `0x080000`-`0x3FFFFF` |

**What the console settled (25 Oct 2026, CD32X BootCamp `edw0`, `edsave`, the cartridge boot), and
ares models since this build:**
- With W = 1, a 68000 write to anything but the cart (work RAM, the VDP, the Sega CD) disturbs the cart
  while an SH2 reads it: the read comes back 0 and the word changes. ares: an SH2 cart read within 1 µs
  of such a write returns 0 and takes the 68000's data (deterministic, not exact). A launcher that leaves
  W on fails in ares as on the console; the one that turns W on only inside its copies boots.
- With the 32X on, the 68000 cannot write cart `0x000100`-`0x07FFFF` directly: ares drops it (a copy goes
  through another window with that bank mapped in).
- The C bit changes nothing on the console. The "RAM cart" use above is kept for discs booted the normal
  way with another cart.
- Bank 31 is the EverDrive's battery RAM, kept on its SD card as `bram.srm` (256 KB) when the ROM's
  header declares save RAM (ares: the `.ram` file). Banks 0-29 are PSRAM and the EverDrive menu wipes
  them at every run; ares keeps the 16 MB in the cart file instead (a choice).
- Still a choice in ares: byte writes to the registers, a console reset.

## Use (Android)

1. Install `ares-cd32x-android-arm64.apk` from the **`android-latest`** release
   (Android 8 or newer, 64-bit ARM). Allow installs from your browser or file manager.
2. Open it and allow **"manage all files"**: a `.cue` names its `.bin` by path, so ares reads
   your game folders directly. Its own files go in `/sdcard/ares/`.
3. **Settings → Sega CD BIOS**: pick your BIOS files. **RAM cart**: which 16 MB cart (1-9) is in
   the slot. During play, *Insert RAM cart…* in the menu swaps carts (the game restarts, as on
   the console); each game remembers the cart it last ran with.
4. Browse to a `.cue` and tap it. Discs boot as **Sega CD 32X + RAM cart**; long-press a game to
   boot it as plain Sega CD instead, or to add a Sega CD disc to a 32X / Genesis cartridge.

The carts are `/sdcard/ares/Systems/RAM Cart 16 MB-<n>.ram`, the same format and names as on
Windows: copy it between the PC's `Systems\` folder and the phone to carry a loaded cart over.
Save states go in `/sdcard/ares/States/`.

Controls: the on-screen 6-button pad, or a controller (X = A, A = B, B = C, L1 = X, Y = Y,
R1 = Z, Start, Select = Mode; R2 holds fast-forward). Back or ☰ opens the menu (save / load
state, reset, log, quit). *Show fps and COMM12 STATE* in Settings shows the boot stack's status.

## What is emulated

| | |
|---|---|
| 68000, Mega CD mode | cart at `0x400000`-`0x7FFFFF`; with the 32X on, only while RV = 1 |
| 68000, 32X windows | `0x880000` (cart 0-512 KB), `0x900000` + bank `0xA15104` |
| SH2 | `0x02000000` (cached) / `0x22000000` (cache-through), read only; stalls while RV = 1 |
| CART_IN | not asserted: the console boots the disc and the SH2 boot ROMs take the `_CD_` path |
| 8 / 16 MB paging | window 0 = cart `0x000000`-`0x1FFFFF`, window 1 = `0x200000`-`0x3FFFFF`; page register `0xA130F0` (window 0) / `0xA130F2` (window 1), even-byte write, page on D8-D10; reset: window 0 = page 0, window 1 = page 1. The 8 MB board decodes D8-D9 (pages 4-7 mirror 0-3); the 4 MB cart ignores the writes |
| Save states | include the cart's SRAM and page registers |

Open hardware questions (whether `/TIME` reaches the board with ADEN = 1, RV timing)
are **not** settled by this emulation: the page register is accepted whether or not
RV is set. Treat a pass here as "the code is right", not "the board will work".

Sega CD + 32X **cartridge** games with CD audio (Sonic 32X Plus, OpenTyrian + Sega CD)
load with **Load → Sega → Mega 32X**; when the cart's header lists the CD, ares asks for
the `.cue` too.

## Building

Three things build from this repository. Nothing about the RAM cart is chosen at build time:
cart size, cart number and write-protect are all settings, at run time.

| What | Built by | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Windows ares (`ares.exe`) | upstream ares' CMake, `desktop-ui` | `build/desktop-ui/rundir/` |
| Android app (APK) | Gradle, with `android/native` (CMake + NDK) inside it | `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk` |
| `ares-headless` test tool (Linux) | CMake, `android/native` | `<build dir>/ares-headless` |

GitHub builds the first two on every push to `main` (`.github/workflows/cd32x-windows.yml`,
`.github/workflows/android.yml`) and publishes them as the `cd32x-latest` and `android-latest`
pre-releases. Both workflows can also be started by hand: **Actions → (workflow) → Run workflow**.
Upstream's full build matrix (`push.yml`) only runs by hand in this fork.

### Windows (`ares.exe`)

What GitHub uses, and what works on a Windows PC:

1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) and open the **MSYS2 CLANG64** shell.
2. Install the tools:
   ```sh
   pacman -S --needed make git cmake ccache ninja mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-clang
   ```
3. Get the source and build:
   ```sh
   git clone <the ares CD32X fork>
   cd <the ares CD32X fork>
   cmake --preset windows-ci-mingw-native
   cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo
   ```
   The first configure downloads ares' prebuilt Windows dependency bundle (`ares-deps`:
   SDL, librashader, slang shaders, ...), as pinned in `deps.json`.
4. `ares.exe` and its DLLs are in `build/desktop-ui/rundir/`. To make it like the release zip,
   add the folders `Systems\` and `bios\` next to `ares.exe` and put your Sega CD BIOS in
   `bios\` as `bios_CD_U.bin`, `bios_CD_J.bin`, `bios_CD_E.bin`.

CMake switches (`-D<NAME>=<value>` on the configure line; the preset sets the ones marked *):

| Switch | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` | `RelWithDebInfo`* | `Release`, `RelWithDebInfo`, `Debug` or `MinSizeRel` |
| `ARES_CORES` | all systems | Which emulators to build, e.g. `-DARES_CORES="md"` for only the Mega Drive family (Genesis, Sega CD, 32X, Sega CD 32X): a much faster build |
| `ARES_BUILD_LOCAL` | `ON` (`OFF`*) | Optimise for the CPU of the PC that builds it (faster there, may not run on older PCs). The release is built with `OFF` |
| `ARES_UNITY_CORES` | `OFF` (`ON`*) | Build each core as one file: faster from scratch, slightly faster emulation, slower rebuilds |
| `ARES_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS` | `OFF` (`ON`*) | Precompile `ares/ares.hpp` |
| `ARES_PROFILE_ACCURACY` | `OFF` | Prefer accuracy over speed in a few places |
| `ARES_ENABLE_CHD` | `ON` | `.chd` disc images (libchdr) |
| `ARES_ENABLE_LIBRASHADER` | `ON` | Video shaders (librashader, slang shaders) |
| `ARES_BUILD_OPTIONAL_TARGETS` | `OFF` (`ON`*) | Also build test programs and tools (`mia`, `mame2bml`, CPU tests) |
| `ARES_BUILD_OFFICIAL` | `OFF` | Official version strings (from the environment variable of the same name) |
| `ARES_SKIP_DEPS` | `OFF` | Don't download the prebuilt dependencies (use your own) |
| `ARES_DEBUG_DEPENDENCIES` | `OFF` | Download the dependencies' source too, for debugging into them |
| `ARES_MINGW_USE_DWARF_SYMBOLS` | `OFF` | DWARF debug symbols for gdb / lldb instead of CodeView |
| `ENABLE_IPO` | `ON` | Link-time optimisation |
| `ENABLE_CCACHE` | `ON` | Use ccache when installed |
| `ARES_COMPILE_DEPRECATION_AS_WARNING` | `OFF` | Deprecation errors become warnings |

Other presets in `CMakePresets.json`: `windows` (Visual Studio 2022 + ClangCL, in `build_vsclang`),
`windows-msvc` (Visual Studio 2022 + MSVC), and the CI variants `windows-ci-cl-native`,
`windows-ci-msvc-native` and the ARM64 cross builds `windows-ci-cl-cross` / `windows-ci-msvc-cross`.

`ares.exe` command-line switches (`ares.exe --help` lists them):

| Switch | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--system "Mega CD 32X" game.cue` | Load a game as a given system, without asking (`"Mega CD"`, `"Mega 32X"`, `"Mega Drive"`, ...) |
| `--setting name=value` | Set a setting for this run only, e.g. `--setting MegaDrive/RAMCartSlot=3` (repeatable; `--dump-all-settings` lists the names) |
| `--settings-file path` | Use another `settings.bml` |
| `--save-state 1`…`9` | Load that save-state slot after the game starts |
| `--fullscreen` / `--pseudofullscreen` | Start full screen / in a borderless window |
| `--kiosk` | Minimal user interface (implies `--no-file-prompt`) |
| `--no-file-prompt` | Don't ask for optional extra files |
| `--shader name` | Video shader to use |
| `--terminal` | Open a console window for log output |
| `--dump-all-settings` | List every setting name and exit |
| `--version`, `--help` | Version string / this list |

The CD32X settings, for `--setting` or `settings.bml`:

| Setting | Values | |
|---|---|---|
| `MegaDrive/RAMCart` | `true` / `false` | RAM cart in the slot for Mega CD 32X games (default `true`) |
| `MegaDrive/RAMCartSlot` | `1`…`9` | Which 16 MB cart: `Systems\RAM Cart 16 MB-<n>.ram` |
| `MegaDrive/RAMCartWriteProtect` | `true` / `false` | The cart's write-protect switch |
| `Input/Defocus` | `Block` / `Allow` / `Pause` | When ares' window loses focus (default `Block`: keeps running) |

Example: start OpenLara on cart 3, full screen:
```bat
ares.exe --system "Mega CD 32X" --setting MegaDrive/RAMCartSlot=3 --fullscreen "C:\Games\OpenLara\CDROMPlayer_cart16_music.cue"
```

### Android (APK)

Needs: JDK 17, the Android SDK (platform 34), NDK **27.2.12479018**, CMake 3.28 or newer, Ninja
and Gradle 8.9 (the repository has no Gradle wrapper: install Gradle, or open `android/` in
Android Studio).

1. Tell Gradle where the SDK and CMake are, in `android/local.properties`:
   ```properties
   sdk.dir=/path/to/Android/Sdk
   cmake.dir=/path/to/cmake        # the folder that holds bin/cmake
   ```
2. Build:
   ```sh
   cd android
   gradle assembleRelease
   ```
3. The APK: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`. Install it with
   `adb install -r app-release.apk`, or copy it to the phone.

Build settings (in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`):

| Setting | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| `applicationId` | `com.micronut99.ares` | |
| `minSdk` / `targetSdk` / `compileSdk` | 26 / 34 / 34 | Android 8.0 or newer (AAudio) |
| `ndkVersion` | `27.2.12479018` | |
| `abiFilters` | `arm64-v8a` | 64-bit ARM phones only. Add `"x86_64"` for the emulator / Chromebooks |
| CMake arguments | `-DANDROID_STL=c++_static -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`, `-O3` | the native core is always an optimised build, also in `assembleDebug` |
| `versionCode` / `versionName` | 1 / `148-cd32x-1` | raise `versionCode` for builds that must install over older ones from stores |
| signing | `app/ci-signing.jks` (store and key password `ares-cd32x`, alias `ares`) | a fixed key in the repository, so every build installs over the last one. Use your own key for builds you hand out widely |

Switches of the native build (`android/native/CMakeLists.txt`):

| Switch | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| `ARES_CORES` | `md` (fixed) | only the Mega Drive family is built |
| `ARES_UNITY_CORES` | `ON` (fixed) | |
| `ARES_ENABLE_CHD` | `ON` (fixed) | `.chd` discs |
| `ARES_ANDROID_HARNESS` | `OFF` | `ON` builds `ares-headless` instead (desktop hosts, next section) |

The native build replaces ares' `sourcery` resource tool with `android/native/cmake/sourcery.cmake`
(it runs at configure time, so nothing has to run on the build machine), and builds without
ares' desktop user interface (`hiro`) and drivers (`ruby`).

### `ares-headless` (Linux test tool)

The Android app's core, with no window: it boots a game, presses buttons on a schedule, saves
screenshots and the sound, and prints the 32X COMM registers every second (COMM12 is the CD32X
boot stacks' status: `4B10` = game running). Used to test CD32X discs without a phone.

Needs clang (C++20), CMake 3.22+ and Ninja. No desktop libraries.
```sh
cmake -S android/native -B build-headless -G Ninja -DARES_ANDROID_HARNESS=ON \
      -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++
ninja -C build-headless ares-headless
```

Example: OpenLara on a blank 16 MB cart, Start pressed at frame 200, screenshots at 30 s and 2 min:
```sh
build-headless/ares-headless --game CDROMPlayer_cart16_music.cue --bios-us bios_CD_U.bin \
  --ramcart cart16.ram --ramcart-size 16 --frames 7200 --press 200:S --press 210: \
  --screenshot 1800:shot30.ppm --screenshot 7199:shot120.ppm
```

| Switch | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--game file` | The game: `.cue` / `.chd` disc, or `.32x` / `.md` / `.bin` / `.gen` / `.smd` / `.zip` cartridge |
| `--disc file` | A Sega CD disc in the drive as well as a cartridge (Sonic 32X Plus, OpenTyrian + Sega CD) |
| `--machine cd32x\|cd\|32x\|md` | Sega CD 32X + RAM cart / Sega CD / 32X / Genesis. Default: discs are `cd32x`, `.32x` is `32x`, the rest `md` |
| `--bios-us`, `--bios-jp`, `--bios-eu file` | Sega CD BIOS per region |
| `--region NTSC-U\|NTSC-J\|PAL` | Force a region (default: from the game, preferring NTSC-U) |
| `--ramcart file` | The RAM cart's file (created blank if missing, written back at the end) |
| `--ramcart-size 4\|8\|16` | 4 MB cart, or the paged 8 / 16 MB board (default 4) |
| `--ramcart-type pcb\|everdrive` | The MicroNut99 carts (default), or a Mega EverDrive PRO (16 MB) as EDBOOT leaves it |
| `--ramcart-boot EDBOOT.BIN` | EverDrive only: boot this launcher ROM from the EverDrive first; it releases CART_IN and starts the Sega CD BIOS |
| `--save-state frame:file`, `--load-state file` | Save a state at that frame (repeatable) / start from a state |
| `--frames n` | How many video frames to run (60 = 1 second; default 600) |
| `--press frame:buttons` | From that frame on, hold these buttons: `U D L R A B C X Y Z M S` (M = Mode, S = Start); `--press 210:` releases all. Repeatable |
| `--screenshot frame:file.ppm` | Save the picture at that frame. Repeatable |
| `--wav file.wav` | Record the sound (48 kHz stereo) |
| `--home dir` | Where the core keeps its files (Sega CD backup RAM); default `./ares-home/` |
| `--interpreter` | SH-2 interpreter instead of the recompiler (slower) |
